These files are used to add monsters to MonsterLoot.

To use:
- Create a handout and name it "Bestiary" plus something along the lines of the name of the text file.
- Copy and paste the contents of the text file directly into the handout. It should put each monster in a separate paragraph.
- Open the MonsterLoot config using `!spoils --config` and click the import button.

Feel free to edit them to your liking before import.

Enjoy!
